## What's 2dog?
Godot, but backwards!

> *To dog, or not to dog. Is it even a question?*


C# front-end for [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot)

(massively WIP!)

Based on Ben Rog-Wilhelm's [zorbathut/libgodot_example](https://github.com/zorbathut/libgodot_example/tree/csharp)


### Legacy Docs
<details>
** What This Is

Once Godot 4.6 is released, most of this won't be necessary.

** How To Build & Run C#

Run `./runit-cs.py`.

It will take a while; it has to build the entire Godot engine twice, plus some more stuff.

Godot is started from C#, then the label text is updated from the same C#. There's no scripting in this project! It's all driven by the outer harness starting Godot itself.

Supports Windows and Linux.

(You can ignore the poetry file, it's just for me.)
