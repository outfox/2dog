# What's 2dog?
It's Godot, but backwards. Godot doesn't start and drive your .NET stuff, your .NET stuff starts and drives Godot. 🦴

## Summary
**2dog** is a .NET/C# front-end for [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot), meaning it can interact with the engine, but isn't bound by its limitations; imagine it like a dog that follows you everywhere, is perfectly loyal, yet that dog can learn new tricks, runs happy circles around you, jumps into your bed, and chases squirrels while you're away.

Everything that Godot and GodotSharp can do, **2dog** does, but this dog knows a lot more tricks, on top.

## (massively WIP!)
Planned features are TRS transforms using the [**fenn**ecs](https://fennecs.net) entity-component system, and a new approach to scene and material definitions. When Godot 4.6 is released, the local build portion of this will likely not be necessary.

# How To Build & Run C#
Init sumodules via `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` as needed. This checks out a lightly modified fork of https://github.com/godotengine/godot .

Run `uv run build.py`, and on success, `dotnet run --project engine`. Only tested on linux so far.)
